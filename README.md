# Pharmacy Management System

Many people don't know if the medicine is available in pharmacies or not, so they waste their time and effort trying to reach many pharmacies to ask about the specific medicine. The goal of this project is to provide a system that interconnect many pharmacies and list all available medicines within each pharmacy to facilitate searching for all medicines.

Targeted users for this app are:

1. Customers: 
- Show the available pharmacies and medicines. 
- Search for any medicine or pharmacy by their names. 
- Pick a medicine to show which pharmacies sell this medicine.
- Select a pharmacy to display medicines available in it.
- Start making their orders by adding to cart the quantities of selected items.
- Show cart and proceed to checkout.
- Enter delivery information and finally place the order.
- Update profile information.
- Logout.

2. Pharmacists:
- Show available medicines in their pharmacy.
- Add or edit a medicine.
- Display orders made from their pharmacy.
- Accept (deliver) order.
- Update profile information.
- Logout.

3. Admin:
